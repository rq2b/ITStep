```python
# static type annotation

var_int: int = 0
var_float: float = 0.11
var_string: str = 'string'
```

**Static type annotation is specifying the type of variable on its creation to prevent further confusion, mismatched types & other issues. Helps the IDE / code editor apply proper methods, as the type is known. Good for readability.**
